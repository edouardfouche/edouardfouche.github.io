This summer, I was invited to present my [research][publications] at KDD, one of the top conference in my field! The conference took place in Anchorage, Alaska. Probably, I would not have come up to go on vacation in Alaska, but since I was there for work, Charlotte and I decided to take some time off to discover the 49th state! 

We spent 18 days in the state, most of it camping in a Jeep Wrangler, with pop top tent. It was a wonderful experience! We had X different stops over the state and drove more than Y miles. This article is our travel log. If you are planning a trip to Alaska, it may be useful to you, if not, maybe you will change your mind :)!

I gave my talk at KDD, and Charlotte arrived shortly after. There are direct flights from Frankfurt via Condor, which was quite convenient for us. The flight take 10 hours, with a -10 hours time shift !
