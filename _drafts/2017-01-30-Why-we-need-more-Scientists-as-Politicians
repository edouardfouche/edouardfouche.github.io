In this period of global political instability, I believe it is time to rethink our system and that we should profoundly change our institutions. There are many things we should probably do. One of the thing is to regularize the way people access to power. Especially, I believe that scientists should and will in the future get more and more involved in governements and political affairs. In this short article, I will explain why I believe that science practitioners should be brought in the center of any modern governments. 

1. Scientists are well educated
-------------------------------

Scientists did some of the most renowed educational paths. They learned hard skills, such as math, physics, medicine. They tackle hard challenges: proving Fermat's theorem (...), discovering new stars and planets, explaining how our brain work, creating new drugs, etc. The discipline they practice structured the way they think and interact with the world: they are fondamentally tied to the scientific approach: learning from existing work, formulating hypothesis, designing experiments, drawing conclusions. 

In this ever changing world, addressing problems following a scientific approach does not seem that bad. If we look at the recent decisions of our political leaders and our people, they seem more and more unpredictable and based on personal beliefs and emotions, instead of facts.  

2. Scientistis are pragmatic
----------------------------

Scientist are pragmatic: they believe there is an explanation for every results, good or bad. When something cannot be explained, this just means that human knowledge has not reached this point yet. Scientist just cannot buy irrational explanations such as the action of a God-like entity, otherwise there is not research questions.   

3. Scientists are honest
------------------------

In the world of science, you cannot afford to lie. Lying includes manipulating results, stealing work from other people without proper quoting or unjustified argumentation. This is such a small word that the community would simply disregard the work of someone known as a lyer. 

4. Scientists can do your job too
---------------------------------

Scientists are trained to practice science. However, successful scientists need to master a whole range of skills: If they are not able to present their ideas and finding in a clear and understandable way, who would buy it? How would they get funding? Top scientists, such as professors, also have to manage a certain number of people, such as Ph.D. Students, Post-Docs. The same can be said about scientists who joined the industry. 

4. Scientists can see the future
--------------------------------

The world is very impredictable, but most of our problems are currently science related: global warming, the raise of AI, drones and advanced weapons. Scientist working in the field are the best to known what our world might look like in our close future. They have - so-to-speak - a heads tart and a full understanding of the problems and their possible implications, so they can think about it way in advance.  

So, why aren't our scientists so influencial yet?
