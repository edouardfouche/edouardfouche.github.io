A few advices for aspiring scientists. 

## Specific Pieces of Advice <a name="specific-pieces-of-advice"></a>

- Choose your research group wisely, then commit. 

About the research group. 

The match advisor/student can be extremely tricky. Usually, your advisor is either a Professor or a Postdoc. In large groups, the actual supervision may be delegated to the senior PhD student in practice. 

The famous professors may not have much time for you. You will most probably end up working with a Postdoc. Then, you need to make sure that your vision resonates with that of this Postdoc. 

Unfamous professors may not have very good connections to other groups, making it harder to reach out to people from other groups having the expertise you need, in case that of your advisor falls short. Then, sadly, older professor may also retire (or even die) before you graduate, leaving you in a difficult position. 

Read several of the recent publications from the group. Keep in mind that you will be expected to product work of comparable quality and publish in comparable venues. 

Find a model.  


- You are a journalist, an archivist and an expert.

As a scientist, you need to find extremely catching story. No-one wants to read in a paper an enumerate of cold facts, you must entertain and motivate your readers, craft catchy titles and catchy abstract. You must know very well the history of similar work and methods and be able to classify them appropriately, i.e., to consolidate and bring order in the current state of the art. You must know better than anyone your own stuff and even beyond. 

- Dream often. 

A common pitfall is too think that taking an unconventional approach to solve a problem is a bad thing. The truth is that, it is when magic happen. Avoid auto-censure. 

- Aim high, start small. 

Start with simpler studies. Then, target better venues. Set yourself reasonable milestones and commit to deliver them no matter what. As a rule a thumb, a good paper should represent about 6 months of work for an experienced scientist. Make sure that you are going in the right direction before commiting to research/implementation activities. Plan strategically. Get a bullet journal. 

- Master the tradeoff between Exploration and Exploitation. 

At the beginning you typically are exploring. 

- Become a master at prototyping.

Find your tools. Thesaurus, Grammarly (?). 

Programming languages. Software: IPE, Mendeley/Zotero, Ubuntu. Setup Calendar, Email client, IDE, Communication tools. TeX Studio. Overleaf. 

- Be patient. 

Research takes time. What the market will be expecting in 3-4 years does not matter much. Your priority is the PhD. Set yourself a set of additional skills you want to have as you finish the PhD and integrate them in your research routines. 

Do not worry about the future. What to do after a PhD

- Be bold, but honest

- Become a master at your own psychology.

Beware of cognitive biais(es). Invent your language. Create rituals. 

- Find your reset button. 

Use your vacation. Have an healthy life-style. Do not have energy drinks or (too much) junk food. Engage in a competitive sport. Go out and visit your family and friends. Most researchers do not have their best ideas at work, but rather when they are on vacation, or in the shower, etc. We often have in mind the myth of the workaholic PhD student. While there will be hard time and hard work sometimes, taking care of your work-life balance is very important. Be kind to yourself and practice self-care. 

Take time off.  Spend time with people you love.
