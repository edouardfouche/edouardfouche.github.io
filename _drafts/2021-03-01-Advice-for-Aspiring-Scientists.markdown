TODO: Call this article "Demystifying the PhD degree". 
Then: Do an article: "Advice for Aspiring Scientists"
Then: Do an article: "Another PhD Story"

If you want to be recognized as an accomplished scientist, you need to do a PhD. While it is an incredibly fulfilling and transcending experience, working towards a PhD also is a long and tedious journey. Here are a few things that I have learned on the way. If you are interested in research, considering doing a PhD, or working on your Bachelor's or Master's thesis, you may find this article useful. 

First, I will go over general facts about doing a PhD (in Germany, in particular): the status of PhD students, different ways of getting a PhD, etc. Then, I will formulate a few specific pieces of advice and finish on a selection of further resources that helped me becoming a better scientist.

## General Thinking and Meta-Advice <a name="general-thinking-and-meta-advice"></a> 

- **What a PhD degree really is** <a name="what-a-phd-degree-really-is"></a>  

There are tons of misconceptions about what a PhD degree is. Simply put, a PhD is the highest academic degree one can get. This degree says that you have made a significant contribution to advancing human knowledge in a specific field. Getting a PhD is like "getting your wings" as a scientist, and this says a lot about you. It says that you can make sacrifices and that you became an expert at learning. It says that you are an explorator: you enjoy challenges, you can find your way in unknown territory, you can deal with loneliness and, finally, you know how to tell the world about the amazing things you have discovered. 

- **The PhD degree often is underrated** <a name="the-phd-degree-often-is-underrated"></a>  

People often forget that the essence of a PhD is very different from any other degree. There are no teachers, no courses, no exams, no deadlines. You are responsible for setting your own goals and find a way to reach them -- You are your own boss. Once you graduate as a PhD, companies often try to see you as an inexperienced student, a neard, sometimes worse: a academic snob. Sometimes, this is a trick to make you accept a lower pay, by letting you believe that you are not-so-valuable. The truth is that you are much more than a student -- you are a scholar. You have become a master at yourself and know how to conduct (international) projects involving various actors: industry partners, students, advisors, administrative staff. You can handle teaching, staffing, legal aspects, financial planning, while being recognized as an expert in a competitive field.

- **The PhD degree is a title** <a name="the-phd-degree-is-a-title"></a> 

The pride to be a doctor in Germany goes as far as writing the PhD title on your door bell, on your personal ID, on your train ticket reservations, etc... which I personally find crazy. This myth of the social status of doctors is very different from my country of origin, France, where basically no-one cares. I do believe however that one should use the title when approate, e.g., in business context. A doctor title may open doors later in top-management positions in major German companies, or in polical spheres... even if this tends to be less and less true. In any case, becoming a doctor requires much more than the desire to reach such status, or the motivation to earn more money in the future, as we will see later. 

- **Doing a PhD in Europe or in the US** <a name="doing-a-phd-in-europe-or-in-the-us"></a> 

Note that in Europe, PhD's and Master's degrees are kept separated, and one does not usually access to a PhD student position without a Master's degree. On the other hand, one doesn't usually have to pass PhD qualification exam, as is typically done in the US. Thus, there is no distinction between "PhD candidates" and "PhD students". Your evaluation mostly bases on your thesis and your defense, and -- indirectly -- the quality of the venues you may have published in. Since in the US, Master and PhD are often bundled together, the typical duration to complete the degree is 5-6 years, while in Europe it is 3-4 years. In the US, when you "only" have a Master's degree, people tend to think that you are a "PhD dropout" (i.e., you did not finish the PhD). In Europe, it is the norm not to pursue a PhD after the Master. On the other hand, we tend to think that the Bachelor (usually a 3 years Curriculum) is a rather short academic education.      

- **Doing a PhD in Germany** <a name="doing-a-phd-in-germany"></a> 

I must say that I have been very lucky with my own PhD experience. I did my PhD in Computer Science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (known as "KIT") -- a top university in Germany. Germany has a long-standing academic reputation and PhD degrees are very well recognized in society. 

In my field, there are basically two types of PhDs, the *Dr. rer. nat.* (Doktor der Naturwissenschaften -- Doctor of Natural Sciences) and the *Dr.-Ing.* (Doktor der Ingenieurwissenschaften -- Doctor of Engineering). While the latter is sometimes considered more applied than the former, they both have the same value. I am personally a *Dr.-Ing.*, but I have met numerous *Dr. rer. nat.* doing much more applied work than me, I would say. 

Traditionally, you tend to inherit the same title as your advisor (so-called *Doktorvater* -- Doctoral father). In principle, the doctoral committee decides which title you get, right after the doctoral defense. 

- **Doing a PhD in the industry** <a name="doing-a-phd-in-the-industry"></a>  

There exists also ways to do a PhD in the industry. In France, this is best known as a **CIFRE** thesis. In Germany, major companies tend to offer a few PhD student positions -- special contracts in which you are expected to work on a research topic, that is deemed important to the company, while you typically also work on other projects as well (often 50/50). 

A PhD in the industry typically is more applied, and is often hard to complete, because of the additional tasks. I did my PhD at the university. Thus, even if I had several collaborations with the industry, I cannot say much more about such model.

- **The status of a PhD student** <a name="the-status-of-a-phd-student"></a> 

In Germany, the conditions to do a PhD are very good. As a PhD student, you get a salary based on a civil servant payscale (TVL-E13), which is more than enough to cover your life expenses. In my case, this was only about 15-20% less than the salary I would have got by starting in the german industry right after graduation. 

Your status is regulated with a proper employement contract at the university that let you save for your future retirement, with legal vacations (30 days per years), legal working time (40 hours per week) and unemployement benefits once the contract expires. Basically, you are not a student anymore. 

Note that, depending on your field, you might not get a 100% position, but those are very common in Computer Science. In comparision, one does not get such good conditions in France or many other countries. 

- **How to find a PhD student position** <a name="how-to-find-a-phd-student-position"></a> 

This is in my opinion the hardest part. Except for a few specific PhD programs and fellowships, PhD student positions are not advertised online. It is easy to understand why: The professors and postdocs of the group have to handle the recrutment process themself, among many other task. By advertising the position, they are likely to get hundreds of applications to deal with, which shrinks their available time for research and teaching. Thus, if the position is published, it will be on the website of the corresponding group, and it is often hard to find -- but that is on purpose. 

Positions are typically given to outstanding students, i.e., they had very good grade, or did an impressive work in their bachelor/master thesis. In that case, you may get directely contacted from a potential advisor (that was my case). If you are actively looking for a position, you may ask a professor that knows if they have an open position, or if they can recommend you to another professor (but that only works if they know each other somehow). If you are in actively looking, you must have an idea already of what your PhD thesis project could be. 

In my opinion, a great thesis is the best indicator for an advisor (and for the student themselves!) that one can conduct a good PhD project. In my field, the expectations from student theses are similar to the expectation from a PhD student for a short period of time, so one can see the student thesis as trial period for a PhD. Oftentimes, the master's thesis serves as a basis for your first PhD paper, i.e., it gives you a head start! You should keep in mind that professors/postdocs are *almost* always looking for talented students, the thesis is your opportunity to show your potential. If you are applying on an adverstised position, you must prepare a very strong application, as the competition is fierce.  

- **How to fund a PhD student position** <a name="how-to-fund-a-phd-student-position"></a> 

The funding of your position usually comes either from: **(1)** the group's university allowance for teaching, **(2)** some large grant like a graduate school or a so-called research training group, or **(3)** an individual fellowship for which you would have to apply personally upfront. In my case, most of my funding came from my partipation in a research training group on [energy data][energy data] (so, **(2)**), and indirectly from being a member in the [Software Campus][Software Campus] program (which is like **(3)** + some industry collaboration). 

Depending on the funding type, the overall experience tends to be slightly different. **(1)** involves more teaching. **(2)** involves participating in interdisciplinary research or large projects. **(3)** tends to give you more freedom, and often comes with networking opportunities with other fellows. 


- **Two PhD models: the monograph vs the cumulative dissertation** <a name="two-phd-models"></a> 

There are basically two PhD models in European universities: **(I) the monograph** and **(II) the cumulative dissertation**. In **(I)**, you work hard for several years and publish one large piece of original research, the doctoral thesis. This is the traditional way of getting a PhD, but it is now somewhat outdated. In **(II)**, you also work hard for several years, but the final dissertation is more or less the concatenation of several units that you have published over those years. 

I believe that **(II)** is a natural response to the ever-evolving pace of modern research. If you were to publish five years of research all at once, chances are high that similar studies have been published meanwhile, making your contribution already somewhat outdated. Especially in my field (Data Science), the state of the art tend to change every few months. Another reason is that **(II)** makes it easier for your doctoral committee to evaluate the quality of the work: If you publish in top conference, then your work must be of top quality, right? -- Well, sadly, that is not always the case, but you must aim for the best venues!

In my case, I did the cumulative model **(II)**. In the end, I also had to bundle the individual contributions together as a monograph (the doctoral thesis, so actually **(I)**). In that case, it is important that the individual contributions relate to each other to some degree, because you need to tell a bigger story. You must plan strategically -- More on that later.   

- **Two PhD starts: the defined topic vs the open topic** <a name="two-phd-starts"></a> 

There are two main ways to start a PhD: **(A)** you get a position where the task(s) to fulfil are known and have been worked out for you, or at least some of the research questions have already been identified by a senior researcher. The second way, **(B)**, let you start without any clear goal, except getting a PhD by making a contribution in a subfield (e.g., Data Mining) of your discipline (e.g., Computer Science). Both ways **(A)** and **(B)** have their pros and cons. 

**(A)** -- the well-defined topic -- has the following features: 
- You are likely to address a topic that fits nicely in a larger scheme or project. 
- Thus, there will possibly be more synergy with other members of the research group. 
- The topic is likely not too small, not too big, so the scope is adequate for a PhD student.
- Originally, this was not your idea, so it might be harder to fully embody it, to live it, to defend it. 
- Your advisor(s) might have specific expectations on how to address the topic, limiting your creativity.
- At start, it is unlikely that you have expertise in the topic, so you are facing a steep learning curve.
- You may end up feeling like a cog in the wheel of someone else's academic career. 

On the other hand, the open topic **(B)** is as follows: 
- You have full freedom to explore and experiment whatever YOU want. 
- You may get a head-start by focussing in an area where you already have some knowledge. 
- No-one can really tell you what to do, you are expected to master this topic by yourself. 
- You obtain more distant supervision. You must develop a high tolerance to uncertainty.
- Consequently, you are likely to feel lonely or isolated -- and to have motivation problems. 
- Aim too small, and people may not be very impressed. Aim too high, and you will not get closure.
- You are even more prone to the imposteur syndrom. It takes time to decide what to do. 

Of course everything is not black or white, you may find something in-between (parts of the research is clear but you must come up and solve new questions on the way). In my case, I was clearly dealing with a type **(B)**: a very open (or I would say, even undefined) topic. What type you get changes fundamentally your approach, in my opinion. I feel that type **(B)** are more common in Germany, while type **(A)** are typical in France. 

- **The duration of a PhD degree** <a name="the-duration-of-a-phd-degree"></a> 

I was in a group where students are expected to graduate within 3 years. In Germany, it is common to take up to 6 years (sometimes even more). A main reason is that you often get additional teaching duties beside your PhD. Depending on your teaching workload, you may not have much time for research. If you are good at teaching (and if you enjoy it), your advisor might want to keep you around for a few more years as well by postponing your graduation. 

I was not completely done after the 3 years, because I needed almost a year to define my own topic (a typical type **(B)** start problem, see above). I finished my PhD in 3.5 years and I was fortunate to get a contract extension to let me complete the thesis, without experiencing the stress of an unemployement status. 

- **Is it possible to fail one's PhD degree?** <a name="is-it-possible-to-fail"></a> 

Not really. What happens is that time may run out and you did not manage to produce enough evidence to convincingly defend your thesis. Except for a few extremely rare cases, one does not fail in the PhD defense. Everyone, and especially your advisor, will stop you from defending your thesis if they feel that you did not contribute enough to be called a doctor. When time runs out, some students finish their thesis under unemployement, or as a side activity besides a new job. Some students loose motivation and never finish. Some students find out early in the PhD program that they just don't want to do it.

Although the perpective of not bringing a PhD to completion, i.e., *failing*, might sound like a bitter outcome, one must also realize that it is just a normal thing. After all, it is just very hard, and one needs some luck. If the price to pay to get a PhD exceeds what one can invest, it is totally OK to walk away and move on with life. In the end, not finishing a PhD only is a *failure* if you see it as such. Absolutely no one is entitled to make you feel bad about it. Also, even as a PhD dropout, job prospects are very good. 

## Specific Pieces of Advice <a name="specific-pieces-of-advice"></a>

- Choose your research group wisely, then commit. 

About the research group. 

The match advisor/student can be extremely tricky. Usually, your advisor is either a Professor or a Postdoc. In large groups, the actual supervision may be delegated to the senior PhD student in practice. 

The famous professors may not have much time for you. You will most probably end up working with a Postdoc. Then, you need to make sure that your vision resonates with that of this Postdoc. 

Unfamous professors may not have very good connections to other groups, making it harder to reach out to people from other groups having the expertise you need, in case that of your advisor falls short. Then, sadly, older professor may also retire (or even die) before you graduate, leaving you in a difficult position. 

Read several of the recent publications from the group. Keep in mind that you will be expected to product work of comparable quality and publish in comparable venues. 

Find a model.  


- You are a journalist, an archivist and an expert.

As a scientist, you need to find extremely catching story. No-one wants to read in a paper an enumerate of cold facts, you must entertain and motivate your readers, craft catchy titles and catchy abstract. You must know very well the history of similar work and methods and be able to classify them appropriately, i.e., to consolidate and bring order in the current state of the art. You must know better than anyone your own stuff and even beyond. 

- Dream often. 

A common pitfall is too think that taking an unconventional approach to solve a problem is a bad thing. The truth is that, it is when magic happen. Avoid auto-censure. 

- Aim high, start small. 

Start with simpler studies. Then, target better venues. Set yourself reasonable milestones and commit to deliver them no matter what. As a rule a thumb, a good paper should represent about 6 months of work for an experienced scientist. Make sure that you are going in the right direction before commiting to research/implementation activities. Plan strategically. Get a bullet journal. 

- Master the tradeoff between Exploration and Exploitation. 

At the beginning you typically are exploring. 

- Become a master at prototyping.

Find your tools. Thesaurus, Grammarly (?). 

Programming languages. Software: IPE, Mendeley/Zotero, Ubuntu. Setup Calendar, Email client, IDE, Communication tools. TeX Studio. Overleaf. 

- Be patient. 

Research takes time. What the market will be expecting in 3-4 years does not matter much. Your priority is the PhD. Set yourself a set of additional skills you want to have as you finish the PhD and integrate them in your research routines. 

Do not worry about the future. What to do after a PhD

- Be bold, but honest

- Become a master at your own psychology.

Beware of cognitive biais(es). Invent your language. Create rituals. 

- Find your reset button. 

Use your vacation. Have an healthy life-style. Do not have energy drinks or (too much) junk food. Engage in a competitive sport. Go out and visit your family and friends. Most researchers do not have their best ideas at work, but rather when they are on vacation, or in the shower, etc. We often have in mind the myth of the workaholic PhD student. While there will be hard time and hard work sometimes, taking care of your work-life balance is very important. Be kind to yourself and practice self-care. 

Take time off.  Spend time with people you love.
