I"M<p>I hate missing my train or arriving at the station to find out that my train is being delayed. This happens often, because German public transports are so unpredictable ! Since I take the train every day for work, it is also a pain to check online every time I leave. I found a solution to this problem, using a Raspberry Pi.</p>
