I"×<p>Nowadays, it has become more and more common to publish on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> before peer-review. There are several (good) reasons for that: (1) Academic publishing takes too much time, and even then, (2) your paper often ends up behind a paywall. In over-hyped fields, the state of the art may change every month (or sometimes, week!), so it is a good way to â€œplant the flagâ€ on your research idea. But what are the consequences of that?</p>
