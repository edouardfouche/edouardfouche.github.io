I"—<p>Instagram, you are toxic. Today I am rewriting the terms of our relationship. I thought you just were a photo-sharing app, but you grew ugly. I am withdrawing your pocket privilege and take measure to limit your influence on my well-being.</p>

<p>You have changed. You used to be a cool mobile-first photo-sharing app. Filters were fun to use and the community was friendly. I liked to use you to keep up with family and friends despite physical distances. As a hobbyst photographer, I thought you would become a replacement for other photo-sharing platforms such as Flickr. Oh boy, I was wrong. It turns out the main purpose of filter is to make look your skin more flat, your food more colourful, and sunsets unreal. Instagram has become a massive display of fake happiness and narcism. I hardly believe that anyone is being truly satisfied with their use of Instagram except for the few having products (and sometimes themselves) to promote.</p>

<p>You are no better than your brother Facebook, your cousin Linkedin, and the likes. There is no way for me to consume the information I am actually interested in without being exposed to tons of ads. Users seem to think that ads are not that bad, and one can choose to disregard them. I think this is wrong. Ads can influence our minds in subtle and unperceivable ways, which may not impact our immediate behaviour (agreed, one may not jump on buying that trendy gadjet) but impact our personality, long-term life planning ability, and eventually happiness. At this stage I do not even want to talk about privacy concerns.</p>

<p>You steal my time. Whenever I am bored, I take you out of my pocket and scroll you. Instead, I should be thinking about the next thing I actually want to do: My next vacations, the next article I want to write, what I will say to loved ones next time I see them. You are putting presure on me to check every day, because stories disappear the next day.</p>

<p>You are an obtacle to my own development. You force me to live with my past. Yes, I am naturally curious and I will continue to check on former friends and lovers, if you provide me the option to seamingly do so. I may unfriend them, but do I really want to? We all make choices in life and need to move on, but sometimes it is easier said than done. I think that I am happy with my life up to now, but I should only be looking forward what the future may bring and how I can shape it. Proximity of the past only slows one down. I know that you are thriving on this.</p>

<p>You are damaging our society by redefining the notion of friendship. I believe the number of likes on a picture actually is inversely correlated to the number of true friends someone has. True friends are those few people caring about me and looking to spend time with me â€“ not those only showing off how great their life is at the moment and hiding how miserable they are otherwise. Yet, we end up all competing for the largest number of likes. We want to display the coolest life, the most beautiful partner, the most beautiful wedding, and we compare each other on extremely shallow levels. The truth is that disasters and drama happens every day, and will happen to most of us some day. Those mostly are tabou on Instagram â€“ we only share distorded picture of our life as we would like it to be. In fact, we do not know how much damage this does.</p>

<p>No, I am not deleting my account. Social media are here to stay and are a new paradigm of our society. We just need to learn how to live reasonably with them. I still need to exist in modern society and to contribute in some way. I may even occasionally post a picture I want the world to see. But from now on, I will keep my distance with you.</p>
