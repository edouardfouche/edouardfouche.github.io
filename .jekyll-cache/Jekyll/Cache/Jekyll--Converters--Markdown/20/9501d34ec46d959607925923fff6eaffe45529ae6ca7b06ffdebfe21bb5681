I"Í<p>Outlier detection has the goal to reveal unusual patterns in data. Typical scenarios in predictive maintenance are the identification of failures, sensor malfunctions or intrusions. This is a challenging task, especially when the data is high-dimensional, because outliers become <em>hidden</em> and are visible only in particular subspaces. In this article, I will discuss approaches based on auto-encoder to discover outliers in high-dimensional data.</p>
