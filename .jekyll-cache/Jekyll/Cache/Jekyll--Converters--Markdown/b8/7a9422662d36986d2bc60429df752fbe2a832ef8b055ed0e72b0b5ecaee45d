I"h<p>I came across the <em>im2txt</em> model for <em>Tensorflow</em>. It is a model developed by <em>Google DeepMind</em> that takes an image as input and creates a caption for it. I used the model to create captions for a few of my own images, and it was a lot of fun ! In this article, I will explain how to play with it. Then, I will show a few examples.</p>
