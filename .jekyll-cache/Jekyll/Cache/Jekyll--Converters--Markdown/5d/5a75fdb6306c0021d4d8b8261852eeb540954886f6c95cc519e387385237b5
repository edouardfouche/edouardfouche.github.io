I"T<p>I became recently interested in the Knightâ€™s Tour problem. It is one of the oldest problem in computer science, known for more than 1000 years! I have written a program in Scala that solves it for arbitrary-shaped chessboards. I find the visual patterns in the solutions quite interesting. In this article, I will talk about that.</p>
