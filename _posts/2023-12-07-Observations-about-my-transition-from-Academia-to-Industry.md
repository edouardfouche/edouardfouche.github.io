!!! DRAFT !!! Please be kind ;)

I was invited in the “To be Honest” conference organised by the German Scholars Organization (GSO) to share my experience about my recent transition from academia into the industry. In this blog post, I will share my two cents about my transition, which took place only two months ago.

The session was called  “Heartbreak or Dance of Joy? Careers After Academia” and the organisers kindly sent us a list of guiding question to prepare for discussion. So will use those questions to structure this post :). 

Please briefly introduce yourself 

→ What’s your current job about? 

I am a Data Scientist at Siemens Smart Infrastructure. My role is to develop data-driven products that can be used all across the company. Of course I am not alone, I work with a team, but I mainly provide the Data Science expertise, which is the field I specialised in during my studies, PhD, Postdoc. I am also involved on a lesser technical level about data strategy topics at Siemens. 

→ At what point in your academic career did you transition? 

I have transitioned after three years being a Postdoc (altogether, I have been employed at the university for seven years). I had a feeling that I had seen enough of the academic world, and as you step up you actually get to do less and less research, more teaching, administrative tasks and management of younger researchers, students and technical staff. That last point can quickly become very frustrating if you do not choose (or poorly choose!) your staff (because the head of the lab) and some of them do not have the right attitude to be in research. I found that as you progress, the expectations about research output becomes higher, but you actually have less control over it (until you actually become a Professor, and even that depends on the position), so progress becomes a game of luck. To some extent, staying in Academia is not even survival of the fittest, but survival of the luckiest (don’t get me wrong, at that level everyone is excellent anyway). 

→ One thing that surprised you after you stepped beyond academia 

Everything must go faster, but we usually have better tools (money is not a problem). Not everyone is so smart. Work/Life balance is much better. 

→ Heartbreak or dance of joy? How did it feel for you personally to move on to a career after academia – and why?

It is leap into the unknown, so that is definitely scary and leaving the academic freedom does trigger a bitter feeling. But for me personally this was a dance of joy. I must say I was really fed up with the academic system and I did not feel I could continue to thrive there. I could still have become a Professor, but my feeling was: “I’ll become a Prof and then what?”. Here in the industry career evolution are much more diverse, and I value that diversity. 

→ What are the differences between working in academia compared to your current job? (Or: what are similarities?) 

Team work is much more important, and I feel much less isolated. I am also in a very large company so there is always someone you can ask if you have a question about something. Quality expectation in the industry tend to be a bit lower, it must be “good enough” and not “perfect”, because investing the time to make things 5% better is not worth it economically, but in Academia, we tend to be focussing on those 5%. 

→ What makes PhD graduates and Postdocs well-equipped for careers beyond academia? 

We are extremely good at comparing things. Which is hard, and people who have no been in science long enough have a hard time to do. 

→ Was there anything you found to be challenging in transitioning – and if so, what helped you address those challenges? 

I find one of the hardest thing is explaining what I did in my time in Academia. Most people just do not understand what you did and they have no clue what process you went through. And when you talk about it, we from academia tend to largely undersell ourself. Some people in the industry would talk about themself like they are expert at something, but the level they need to call themself “expert” at something is very far below the level we need as research-person. That is important to keep in mind, no to take everything for its face value. 

→ What has helped you the most in getting to where you are right now in your career (e.g. skills, networking, visibility, mentors, etc.)? 
 Resilience. Simply, to never give up. Networking is very helpful too. For example, if you happen to have someone in your network that is working for the company you are applying to, it can be very helpful to get in touch with them about salary negotiations, and when are about to make a decision about to join or not. 

→ How can you prepare yourself for a career after academia? 

Doing some internship. Try to break the stereotype of the crazy scientist. The message should be “yes, I am a scientist, but I am so much more than that”. 

→ Is there a good time to leave academia? Or in other words: Can it ever be too late? 
 
I think it is never too late. But some timing in not optimal. Earlier is easier, then it gets harder and harder. But it seems that there is a market for senior prof that are brought to lead some corporate research lab, but that is much much later. 

→ Let’s be honest, what should we be aware of when it comes to leaving academia? 

There are many positions out, but it is hard to find a position that will be truly interesting to you. Even if you are awesome, you will face many rejections and it will take time to find a position. 

→ What advice would you give to your younger self (PhD candidate/ Postdoc)?

Do no worry so much. It’s gonna be alright. And push that idea of yours to go do some internship it will make your life later easier. Haters gonna hate.  

→ What piece of advice do you give to younger researchers who are considering transitioning beyond academia today? 

There are many people in Academia that will try to discourage you. Do not listen to them and find out what you really want to do. Consider what it will take from you to continue in Academia and make a decision based on whether you are ready to do that.  

→ What was the best piece of advice you have received on your way towards a career after academia? 

That is kind of sad to say, but I did not get any piece of advice that is worth mentioning as “good”. Actually I often got bad advice. Perhaps one reason is that I have not got the chance to get a mentor so far. One thing that I want to share is that just when I announced at the university that I am leaving, I had a talk with the person who was responsible for the whole teaching activities at the faculty, and she told me something I will remember for a long time: “Mr. Fouché, it is great that you are going to industry. It will be a very valuable asset to have some years of experience in the industry when later you apply for professorships.” The bottom line for me is that there are two ways to approach career in general (and there it does not matter much, academia or not). There is the typical path: Do that PhD with this famous Professor, then go do a Postdoc in the US, write that nature paper. And, there is that other path, where you actually do whatever you want, be authentic and things turns out fine because people value your unique experience and want to hire you because you can bring something different. But keep in mind, those positions are rare because people tend to want to hire people who are alike.
