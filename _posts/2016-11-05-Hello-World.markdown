and welcome ! In this blog, I will speak about my work as a computer scientist, but also about art, culture, and all those things that fascinate me. I have decided to create this place to share freely with you a part of my thoughts. Also, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone.

Furthermore, I have been profiting so much from the content of the web, that I want to give it back to the community and contribute. I'll try to create interesting content and convey information in a simple way.

Why I think this adventure is scary:
- Writing is a tedious exercise, especially if you're not writing in your mother tongue.
- Fear of human judgement about my skills (OMG YOU HAVE A TYPO).
- Fear of not having enough things to say or to be boring.

Despite its scariness, it might be worth a try ! 

This blog is based on [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and the code is hosted on [Github][github]. I moved my old CV-only Bootstrap-based website to Github Pages and created a blog sections, which you are reading now. Feel free to reuse or adapt my code. I would appreciate a reference if you take my design :). Note that several improvements (style, UI, code factoring) still have to be made... well, this blog is alive !  

Thanks for reading this post, you are the best !

Cheers, 

Edouard Fouch√©
