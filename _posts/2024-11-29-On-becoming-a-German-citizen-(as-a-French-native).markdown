Last week, Nuremberg City Hall hosted a celebration for all its residents who obtained German citizenship this year, myself included. It was a nice opportunity to meet fellow "new" German citizens, and shake the hand of Mayor Marcus KÃ¶nig.

I am now proud to call myself a French-German citizen of Europe. Despite our countries' tumultuous history, we have managed to cultivate a unique bond of friendship. Growing up, I was exposed to the stories of my grandparents, who experienced World War II as children. My grandfather was unable to attend school because his village's school was destroyed by German bombers. The Gestapo arrested the local priest for hiding Jews, and he was killed in a concentration camp.

Despite this painful past, I am pleased to represent the friendship between our two nations. It shows that within just two generations, the horrors of war can be put behind us, without forgetting the lessons they have taught us. I feel humbled to contribute to the legacy of those who have championed the French-German friendship, following in the footsteps of Adenauer, de Gaulle, Brandt, Pompidou, and others.

As an added bonus, I now get to vote twice more ;). 

How about you? If you had been living in Germany (or any other country) for a long time, would you consider obtaining its citizenship?
