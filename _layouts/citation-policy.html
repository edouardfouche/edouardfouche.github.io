    <b> How to cite </b>
    <br>
    Citing blog article is never easy and sometimes frowned upon among academics. But there are a few resources out there you can use to properly cite the materials. For example, see this white paper from Cambridge University on <a href="https://www.research-integrity.admin.cam.ac.uk/files/citing_blogs_as_reference_sources.pdf">Citing Blogs</a>, and this guide from bibtex if you use LaTeX: <a href="https://bibtex.eu/faq/how-can-i-use-bibtex-to-cite-a-website/">How can I use BibTeX to cite a website in LaTex?</a>
    <br>

    My recommendation is to use BibLatex, the citation must at least include
    </p>

    <p class="content-paragraph">
    <ul style="font-size:18px;">
          <li>Name of the author(s)</li>
          <li>Title of the article</li>
          <li>Year it was published</li>
          <li>URL</li>
          <li>Date of access</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>

    <p class="content-paragraph">
    With BibLatex, here is how an entry to my blog may look like: 
    </p>

    <pre style="color:white">
    @online{EdouardFouche2023,
      title        = {Observations about my transition from Academia to Industry},
      author       = {Edouard Fouch√©},
      year         = 2023,
      url          = {https://edouardfouche.com/Observations-about-my-transition-from-Academia-to-Industry/},
      urldate      = {January 5th, 2025}
    }</pre>
